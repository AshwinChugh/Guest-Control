# Guest Control
 A simple tool to increase control over your computer and prevent procrastination. 
 Inspiration came from when my brother wanted to play minecraft on my PC but I did not want him opening applications and 
 programs that were not meant for him. I put this program together to do exactly that. This program can also be used to prevent 
 procrastination. I often get carried away and waste time when I end up opening programs like Discord, Spotify, Skype etc. 
 'Guest Control' helps combat this because it prevents that program from ever opening. This is a WPF(Windows Presentation 
 Format) tool--asa result, this program will only run on Windows machines.
